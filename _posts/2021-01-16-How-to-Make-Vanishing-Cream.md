## Ingredients 

- Water 75ml 
- Stearic Acid (ebay) 10g
- Glycerin (walgreen) 10g
- Cetyl alcohol （ebay）or Stearyl alcohol or Cetostearyl alcohol    0.5g 
- Mineral oil (walgreen) 3g
- Potassium hydroxide (ebay) 0.5g



## Steps

1. Mix everything in a container, better made of glass or metal.
2. Heat it up to 90 degree with water bath method. The temperature does not need to be very precise.
3. Stir the mixture for at least 5 minutes to make it creamy and fogy, better to use a hand mixer
4. Cool it down and keep it in refrigerator . You can also freeze it if you made a lot and use a tiny jar for weekly use.

**Do not add so called natural ingredients such as Milk, Herbs or even fragrance oil, because they can make your cream easily go bad and cause allergy! **



## If you want to understand more

Stearic acid is the main component in all fat, such as vegetable oil and animal oil.

So called lotion or cream is simply the mixture of oil and water. 

However, water and oil cannot be mixed, as we all know. We need something called emulsifier to mix these two.

When being heated, stearic acid and potassium hydroxide can turn into soap, which is a typical emulsifier.  

Since we only add a little bit potassium hydroxide and a lot of stearic acid,  we will not end up with a jar of soap and instead there will be a lot of stearic acid left to mix with water, forming cream.

**Thus, the fundamental essence of cream is just stearic acid mixed with water by emulsifier from the interaction of stearic acid and alkali (potassium hydroxide).**



What about other ingredients?

- Glycerin and mineral oil makes the cream function better as moisturizer

- Cetyl alcohol or Stearyl alcohol or Cetostearyl alcohol are also emulsifier and help make the cream smoother.  But they cannot work alone.
