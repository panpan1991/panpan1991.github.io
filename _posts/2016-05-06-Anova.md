The result is

where 

- $$104559$$ is SSE of the full model
- $$22394$$ is SSR contributed by Unemployment_Rate, or is the increased SSE if we reduce Unemployment_Rate from the full model
- $$894463$$ is SSR contributed by Interest_Rate, or is the increased SSE if we reduce Interest_Rate from the full model

These are two F test to **comparing two reduced models with the full model**

| Model comparison                    | F value    |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Y~ Interest_Rate  vs full model     | F = 4.4977  |
| Y~ Unemployment_Rate vs full model  | F =179.6477 |

**Both reduced models are rejected because they significantly increased MSE!**



**For full model:**

$$
SSTO=SSRs+SSE 
$$

SSRs are the variance explained by the regression.  For multiple regression, there are more than one SSR, from different parts of the regression.

**For a model only including intercept**, 

$$
SSTO=SSE 
$$


As we all know, SSTO is always the same.

- **When SSRs are increased, SSE is decreased.**

- **The reduction of SSE is equivalent to the total value of SSRs.**

SSRs are increase by introducing more complex regression models.



In practice, we favor simpler models. 

So we propose a reduced model.

The reduced model, of course, has decreased SSR and increased SSE.

Correspondingly, it also has decreased MSR and increased MSE.



We test the ratio of increased MSE and the original MSE

$$ F=\frac{\text{Increased MSE}}{\text{Original MSE}} $$

If F is large, it means the MSE is significantly increased and the reduced model is overly reduced and does not work here.
