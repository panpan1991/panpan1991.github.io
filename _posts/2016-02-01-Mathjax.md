Mathjax can render LaTex formulas in markdown file or in html pages.

It just need to be included in _include/head.html

```
<!-- Mathjax Support -->
<script type="text/javascript" async
  src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script>
```

**It has to be mentioned that by so far kramdown in githubpages can only use mathjax2.7.1, instead of newer versions**.

Mathjax does not use \$\$ define a math block.

However, Kramdown use double dollar sign to define both inline and display math mode. So there is no need to configure Mathjax.

When you need to use display mode, leave a blank line in both front and behind of the double dollar signs. 

```
//blank line
$$
formula...
$$
//blank line
```
